# Blink Mobile Shell for iOS
We are excited to introduce you to Blink. Blink is a unique mobile shell for iOS. We are creating the terminal we wanted to have and use all day: fully configurable, great keyboard support, great terminal rendering, and crazy fast thanks to [Mosh](https://github.com/mobile-shell/mosh). We won't stop there, and plan to convert this into a great work environment by adding other tools like scp. Hope you find on it a trusty and enjoyable tool too.

# Obtaining Blink

Bugs should be reported here on GitHub. Crash reports will be automatically reported back to us thanks to HockeyApp. If you have any questions or want to make sure we do not miss on an interesting feature, please send your suggestions to our Twitter account [@BlinkShell](https://twitter.com/BlinkShell). We would love to discuss them with you! Please do not use Twitter to report bugs.

We can't wait to receive your valuable feedback. Enjoy!

# Using Blink
Our UI is very straightforward and optimizes the experience on touch devices for the really important part, the terminal. You will jump right into a very simple shell, so you will know what to do. Here are a few more tricks:
- Use two fingers tap to create a new shell.
- Move between shells by swapping your finger.
- You can exit the session and get back to the shell to open a new connection.
- You can also close a session by dragging two fingers down.
- Use pinch gesture to increase or reduce size of text. You can also use Cmd+ or Cmd- if using the keyboard.
- Copy and Paste by selecting text o tapping the screen.
- Run 'config' to setup your keys. Install them to a server through ssh-copy-id.
- Ctrl and Alt modifiers at the SmartKeys bar allow for continuous presses, like in a real keyboard.
- In an external keyboard, use Cmd or Caps as Ctrl and Alt as meta (Default configuration).
