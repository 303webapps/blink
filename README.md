# Blink Mobile Shell for iOS
Do Blink! Blink is the first professional, desktop-grade terminal for iOS that leverages the support of Mosh and SSH. Thus, we can unequivocally guarantee stable connections, lightning-fast speeds, and full configurations. It can and should be your all-day-long tool. [Check it out!](www.blink.sh)

We did not create another terminal to fix your website on the go. Blink was built as a professional grade product from the onset. We started by analyzing what the must-haves were and we ended up grounding Blink on these three concepts:
- Fast rendering: dmesg in your Unix server should be instantaneous. We can't wait even a second to render. We didn't need to reinvent the wheel to make this happen. We simply used Chromium's HTerm to ensure that rendering is perfect and fast, even with those special, tricky encodings.
- Always on: Mosh transcends SSH's variability. Mosh overcomes the unstable and intermittent connectivity that we all associate with mobile connections. You can check your Safari without fear of having to restart the SSH connection. You can flawlessly jump from home, to the train, and then the office thanks to Mosh. Blink is rock-solid connected all the way. Mosh is readily available and can be easily installed on your server. Go to https://mosh.mit. 
- Fully configurable: Blink embraces Bluetooth-coupled keyboards with gusto. But there's more, because we want more. Some like Caps as Esc on Vim, others Caps as Ctrl on Emacs. Blink champions them all. During your always-on sessions, you're in your zone. As well, custom themes and fonts are on the way.

But, Blink is much more. Please read on:
- You should command your terminal, not navigate it. Blink will jump you right into a friendly shell and it'll be clear to you how to roll.
- The interface is straightforward. We dumped all menus and went full screen for your terminal.
- Use swipe to move between your open connections, slide down to close them, and even pinch to zoom!
- Configure your Blink connections by adding your own Hosts and RSA Encryption keys. Everything will look familiar and you get to work, fast!
- We've incorporated SplitView, for those necessary Google searches and chats with coworkers.

# Using Blink
Our UI is very straightforward and optimizes the experience on touch devices for the really important part, the terminal. You will jump right into a very simple shell, so you will know what to do. Here are a few more tricks:
- Type 'help' to find information at the shell.
- Use two fingers tap to create a new shell.
- Move between shells by swapping your finger.
- You can exit the session and get back to the shell to open a new connection.
- You can also close a session by dragging two fingers down.
- Use pinch gesture to increase or reduce size of text. You can also use Cmd+ or Cmd- if using the keyboard.
- Copy and Paste by selecting text o tapping the screen.
- Run 'config' to setup your keys. Install them to a server through ssh-copy-id.
- Ctrl and Alt modifiers at the SmartKeys bar allow for continuous presses, like in a real keyboard.
